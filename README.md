This is a simple programm to create, read, edit and delete notes. The programm requires the folder "notes" to load stored notes. If there were no "notes" folder before, the programm will create the folder. 
For running the programm download and execute NoteTakingApp.exe file. For the ease of first use you could also download the folder "notes" where some test notes are stored.
